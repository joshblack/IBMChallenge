# IBM Design Challenge

> Josh Black

Hello IBM Design team! In this folder is my submission for the IBM Design Challenge. I had a lot of with this assignment and I hope you enjoy what I ended up making!

In order to complete this challenge, I leveraged the following tools and technologies:

- CSS
    - Sass
    - Bourbon with Neat
    - Autoprefixer
    - CSS minifier
- JavaScript
    - jQuery
    - Velocity: animations
    - Gulp: build system for assets
    - Node.js: to serve files
    - Uglify
- Browser sync for automagically injecting CSS and JavaScript into the page while I was building it
- `imagemin` for image assets
- An iconfont generator for gulp to allow me to use `.svg` files as a single font face in my project

In order to view this project, simply do the following:

1. `git clone https://github.com/joshblack/IBMChallenge.git` or unzip the submitted folder
2. `cd IBMChallenge`, or whatever the folder name is called
3. `npm install --production`, for node dependencies
3. `node index.js`, the home page will be available at `localhost:3000`.
4. Tested on the iPhone 5 and HTC One. Preferred viewport width is less than 480px.

Once again, thank you so much for this opportunity. I'm very excited to see all of you in Austin this Friday!

Sincerely, Josh Black
